# multisig-wallet

This is a smart contract for a MultiSigWallet written in the Solidity programming language. The contract is licensed under the MIT License and is compatible with the Solidity compiler version 0.8.17 and later.

The contract includes various events that are emitted throughout its lifecycle, such as Deposit, Submit, Approve, Revoke, and Execute. These events can be used to track the actions taken on the contract by its users.

The contract also includes a struct called Transaction which stores information about a transaction that is submitted to the contract. The struct contains fields for the recipient address, value, and data.

The contract also has an array of address called owners, which stores the address of the owners of the wallet. The contract also has a mapping from address to bool called isOwner, which stores whether an address is an owner or not. The contract also has a variable called required which stores the number of approvals required to execute a transaction.

The contract includes several functions such as submit, approve, execute, and revoke. These functions are used to submit, approve, execute and revoke a transaction respectively. The contract also includes several modifiers such as onlyOwner, txExists, notApproved and notExecuted which are used to ensure that only owners can perform certain actions on the contract and that the transactions being acted upon are valid.

The contract also includes a receive function which is payable and is used to deposit funds into the contract. The contract also includes a private function called _getApprovalCount which is used to count the number of approvals for a given transaction.

This MultiSigWallet smart contract can be used to create a multi-signature wallet where multiple owners are required to approve a transaction before it can be executed. This provides an added layer of security to ensure that no single owner can execute a transaction without the consent of the other owners.
